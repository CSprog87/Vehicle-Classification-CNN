> Vehicle classification from images

## The Business problem

A company that has a large inventory of used cars and wants to create a website or a mobile app to make it easier for customers to search and find the exact car they are looking for. One way to improve the user experience would be to allow customers to search for cars by make and model. However, manually entering this information for every car in the inventory could be time-consuming and error-prone.

Using a machine learning model capable of classifying vehicle make and model from images, the company could automatically extract this information from pictures of the cars. This would make it faster and more accurate to input the information, allowing customers to easily search and filter cars by make and model. This would not only improve the customer experience but also save the company time and resources. Additionally, the model could be used to automatically identify and categorize new cars as they come into the inventory.
